          <p><b>Spiritual Quotient</b> is an app that computes a score which points to your overall progress on your spiritual path. It is a quantification of your achievements.</p>
          <p>This is done by answering a set of questions. The answers are to be chosen from multiple choices. Each answer has marks, which determine your final score. The score is then normalized on a 0-100 scale.</p>
          <p>In this version there are 6 sections, each with 5 questions, each having 4 probably answers. Select a <b>Section</b> on home screen, select your answers by tapping on a choice, press <b>Next</b> or <b>Previous</b> buttons to answer other questions.</p>
          <p>Once the quiz is finished. Tap the <b>View Results</b> button on the home screen to view the Results. You can <b>Analyze</b> your answers, where a possible reason is given and some suggestions are offered. You can see your <b>Rank</b> among all the seekers worldwide. You can also <b>Share</b> the screenshot of your SQ score with your friends and family.</p>
          <p>At any time you can change some answers and recompute the results. You can also erase all the data and start over.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>This app is free and open sourced. And will always remain so. It has no ads or in app purchases. It is free for all as in air. The quiz is totally customizable. Anyone can change the questions or answers or add more sections to it. This ensures that no one dictates what an SQ should mean. We seekers, by nature, like <b>freedom</b>. We do not want some random number to define what we are. So unlimited freedom has been provided for those who are interested in producing their own Spiritual Quotient framework.</p>
          <p>To <b>Save</b> the quiz in xml format, tap the top menu (three dots icon on home page). You can change the xml and save it as a new file, which you can <b>Load</b> back in the app from menu. If you wish to change how the SQ gets computed, you can edit the source in Android Studio (See Resources below for a link to Github repository.).</p>
          <p>The purpose of this app is not to judge or evaluate people, an app cannot do that, its purpose is to help the seekers by pointing out their mistakes or blind beliefs. The aim of this app is to assist seekers on their path. The SQ is a tool, not a judgement.</p>
          <p>We hope this app will be useful and entertaining for you all. :) Please share and provide feedback.</p>
